    Client DMQ Pop request definitions / handler.

    The Pop request attempts to pop one record from the specified DMQ channel.
    This works as follows:
        1. The client selects a connected DMQ node from its registry at random.
        2. A request is sent to the selected node, asking for a record from the
           specified channel.
        3. If the channel on that node contains data, one record is popped and
           returned to the client. If no records are available in the channel on
           that node, then another node is selected and steps 2 and 3 are
           repeated.
        4. The request ends when either a record is sent to the client or all
           available DMQ nodes have been queried and returned no data.
